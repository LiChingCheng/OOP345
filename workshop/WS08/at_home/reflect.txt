The advantage that smart pointer syntax provides.
The biggest advantage of the smart pointer is that the smart pointer can fix the memory leak problem. When it goes out of scope, 
the memory that it points to is deallocated automatically. 

List the difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in your solution.
Raw pointer
Product* product = new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price);
		product->validate();
		priceList += product;
		delete product;             ————->deallocate the pointer.
		product = nullptr;

Smart pointer
std::unique_ptr<Product> product(new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price));
		product->validate();
		priceList += product;

When we use raw pointer we need to deallocate the pointer by ourself. 
However, we do not need to deallocate the pointer when we use the smart pointer.
