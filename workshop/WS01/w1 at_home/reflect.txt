Reflection 1

   In this workshop, the most important concept is how to use the internal linkage and external linkage.
When the compiler reads the external key word, for example(in our String.cpp):extern const int INITIAL,
it will know it needs to go to another translation unit(w1.cpp) to find the definition. 
It means the INITIAL in those different translation units are the same variable.
However, the internal linkage can only be use within its own translation unit. 
Even two internal linkages in different translation units have same name, they are the different variables.

In the process() function, we call the String constructor, which receives one parameter, 
when we assign the temporary String object to the String a. After we assign the temporary object to a, 
we call the destructor.Finally, the changes that we make in String class is that we change the length 
of the string from static memory to dynamic memory, then we can store all of the characters from user input.
